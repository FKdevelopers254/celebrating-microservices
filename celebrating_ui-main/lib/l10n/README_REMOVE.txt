The following files are deprecated and should be deleted for ARB-based localization:
- app_localizations.dart
- app_localizations_en.dart
- app_localizations_es.dart
- app_localizations_fr.dart
- app_localizations_de.dart
- app_localizations_it.dart
- app_localizations_sw.dart
- app_localizations_ar.dart

Only ARB files (app_en.arb, app_es.arb, etc.) and the generated app_localizations.dart from Flutter's gen-l10n should remain.
